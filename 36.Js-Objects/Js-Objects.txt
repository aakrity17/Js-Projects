JavaScript Objects
You have already learned that JavaScript variables are containers for data values.
This code assigns a simple value (Fiat) to a variable named car:

-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h2>JavaScript Variables</h2>
<p id="demo"></p>
<script>
//Create and display a variable:
let car =  "BMW"
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = car;
</script>
