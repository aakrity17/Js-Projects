<!-- When to use Js var
Always declare javascript variables with var, let or const.
The var keyword is used in all js code from 1995 to 2015.
The let and const keywords were added to js in 2015
If you want your code to run in older browers, we must use var.

When to use JS const:
If we want a general rule, always declare variables with const
if you think the value of the variable can change use let
In this example, price1, pricr2, and total are variables:
-->
<!doctyle html>
<html>
<body>
<h2> JS variables </h2>
<p> In this example, price1, price2, and total are variables. </p>
<p id = "demo"> </p>
<script>
const price1 = 5;
const price2 = 6;
let total = price1 + price2;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTMl = "The total is : "+total;
</script>
</body>
</html>
