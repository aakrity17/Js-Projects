<!-- JS Print
Js doesnot have any print object or print methods
You cannot access output devices from js
The only exception is that you can call the window.print() method in the browser to print the content of the current window.-->

<!doctype html>
<html>
<body>
<button onclick = "window.print()">Print this page </button>
</body>
</html>
